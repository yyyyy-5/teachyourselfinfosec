<p>Inspired by <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">Teach Yourself Computer Science</a>, this guide intends to provide a basic set of resources for getting started with learning computer security while also answering the following questions: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Which subjects</strong> should you learn, and why?</li>
<li>What are the <strong>best books / video series / CTF challenges</strong> for each subject?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tl-dr-">tl;dr:</h2>
<p>The consensus is that to build a strong foundation for infosec, you will want to start by studying <strong>networking</strong>,<strong> operating systems</strong> fundamentals (Windows &amp; Linux), and some sort of scripting/<strong>programming</strong> language like Python or Bash. Study these first, and then dive into another subject (some of which are listed here) that piques your interest, if you want. There are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cybersecurity-domain-map-ver-30-henry-jiang/">many domains of infosec to explore</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-most-important-skill">The most important skill</h3>
<p>Being able to research effectively is the most important skill that a learner can have. No one knows everything, you will inevitably forget things, and as your knowledge/experience increases, you will inevitably need to research questions that do not have a straightforward answer. </p>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you know how to find the answer to a question, you know the answer to the question. </p>
<p>Basic research guide coming soon, but some quick tips in the meantime: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en">Google search operators</a> allow you to look for data on specific sites, in specific formats (e.g. <code>&quot;webshell&quot; site:github.com file:.aspx</code> will return ASPX webshells on Github.com)</li>
<li>Typing the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/">man</a> or <strong>help</strong> command on Linux/Unix and Windows (respectively) before a command will give you more information on the arguments the command takes and how to use it.</li>
<li>If there a specific domain you&#39;re interested in, Google <code>awesome &lt;domain&gt;</code> (e.g. &#39;awesome networking&#39; or &#39;awesome osint&#39;). This will bring up a lot of resources related to the topic you&#39;re interested in, typically in a Github repo. </li>
</ul>

<li>You can use certification guides as general subject study guides, without taking the exam (which costs money). A lot of IT certifications are glorified vocabulary tests that try to hit as many relevant points as possible, so they&#39;re excellent for rapidly understanding the basics. </li>

<h2 id="malware-analysis">Malware Analysis</h2>
<p>A prerequisite for malware analysis is setting up an environment where you can safely detonate and analyze malware, and reset the environment back to &#39;normal&#39; once you&#39;re done. This is generally done through the use of <strong>virtual machines</strong> (VMs), which are essentially emulated computers that you can run from your own machine (host OS) or the cloud (You can also use Docker containers). <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/07/flare-vm-the-windows-malware.html">FireEye&#39;s FLARE VM</a> is a Windows 10 environment that comes with a ton of preinstalled tools for both dynamic and static analysis. Note that you will need a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-an-iso-file-for-windows-10-38547366-1dcb-7afd-1726-9eb222d72705">Windows 10 ISO</a> for it. <a href="https://remnux.org/">REMnux</a> is a Linux-based toolkit for malware analysis, and is especially helpful for analyzing malicious documents (maldocs)</p>

<li><em>Practical Malware Analysis</em> is a book that takes students through the basics of static and dynamic analysis, basic disassembly, and malware functionality. Each chapter has a set of labs which are downloadable via the <a href="https://practicalmalwareanalysis.com/labs/">book website</a>.<ul>
<li>The amazing Sam Bowne periodically hosts an online PMA course (using the textbook and going through the projects) which he graciously allows any student to audit online for free. Check his website to see if he&#39;s teaching it soon, or use the videos/lecture notes from a <a href="https://samsclass.info/126/126_S21.shtml">previous iteration</a>.</li>

<h4 id="what-do-i-do-about-my-imposter-syndrome-">What do I do about my imposter syndrome?</h4>
<p>Imposter syndrome involves feeling like you&#39;re incompetent and will inevitably fail, despite your experience / education / skills / accomplishments. </p>
<p>What to do about this? Practice failing. When you have imposter syndrome, the idea of failing can cause you to feel paralyzed, or make you overreact when you make a mistake. When you practice failing, you realize that making mistakes is inevitable. Failure is fleeting, but so is success. When you go into things with the mindset of doing your best, but accepting that you may not be perfect, you become resilient to failure. </p>
<p>We&#39;ve all accidentally mis-triaged something or accidentally brought down a production server for a few hours. It doesn&#39;t make you a bad or stupid or careless person. While making a mistake or miss does not have any bearing on who you are, the way you recover from the miss does. At the end of the day, people are too busy thinking/worrying about themselves, and will not remember you making a mistake. People WILL remember you if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>show <strong>self-awareness</strong> by analyzing your process</li>
<li>show <strong>passion</strong> by caring about your mistake</li>
<li>show <strong>resilience</strong> and <strong>humility</strong> by overcoming your anxiety/frustration and using the mistake as a learning opportunity</li>
<li>show <strong>leadership</strong> by using your mistake as a chance to teach others the lessons you learned</li>
</ul>
<p>A good way to practice failing is to try something new or difficult with other people (or with a mentor) and mess up in front of them. Fail to do the really hard CTF challenge and ask for help. Push through the paralysis that sets in when you&#39;ve realized you&#39;ve started a very bad drawing, finish it, and show it to someone. Allow yourself to not do things perfectly. </p>
<p>Also, write down your &#39;wins&#39; - the things you have accomplished and are proud of - so that when you make a mistake, you can remember that you&#39;ve also done awesome things and will continue to both excel and fuck up in the future. It is inevitable. </p>
<h4 id="how-do-i-stay-up-to-date-on-infosec-topics-">How do I stay up-to-date on infosec topics?</h4>
<p>If you generally want to stay informed, here are a few options: </p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter - I will follow different tags and groups of users and then use <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/" title="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/</a> to get a good view of things happening day-to-day </li>
<li>Email aggregation feeds/lists - I&#39;m subscribed to the following email newsletters: SANS NewsBites (which talks about major things happening related to infosec incl new laws and shit, it also has commentary from different people. I added a screenshot) and Daniel Miessler&#39;s Unsupervised Learning newsletter which is pretty good</li>
